Another editor, who appears to be stalking me and is reverting everything that I do, claims that I am \"\"overlinking\"\" by doing this. I have read the policy, and think I understand it, and I disagree with him. The word \"\"Sacramento\"\" was not linked anywhere else in this article before I made the link, and I think that my link provided good context for a reader who did not know Walnut Creek but thought that maybe they knew Sacramento. Was there anything wrong with my link? I would like someone objective to give their opinions.'\n",
